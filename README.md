# Dolphin Controller

Video games were meant to be played together. All you need to play a game with friends on Dolphin is your laptop and this app, over bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

## To-Do
Add shake detection via gyroscope
Modify macOS server

## Installation & Usage

1. [Download the latest version of Dolphin emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org)
2. Build app from source code (Could add to the app store if there is enough demand)
3. From the iOS app, tap "Join" and find your server
4. Pick a controller number by tapping P1, P2, P3, or P4

## Setup

In order for the app to interact with the Dolphin Emulator software, this app takes advantage of [Dolphin's pipe input feature](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Pipe_Input).

The server will automatically write the correct config and create the required FIFO pipes.

From the Dolphin app, open the controller settings (Options > Controller Settings in the menu bar). For each controller you wish to connect in-game, change "Port N" to "Standard Controller".

### Verification

You can verify the controller is connected by clicking "Configure" and ensuring "Device" is connected to "Pipe/0/ctrlN". From the configure window, you can also verify that the UI responds to interactions on your iOS device.

## Tips

* The iOS app will attempt to auto-reconnect with the same controller number if it looses a connection (if your screen locks or the app backgrounds).
* In the server browser window (after tapping "Join") the â˜…'d server is the one last connected to.
* Servers are advertised automatically with Bonjour, so no need to enter manual information if everyone's in the same room.
* For remote play, tap the Network icon in the macOS app's toolbar to find the port, forward to a public IP address, and enter the address manually.
